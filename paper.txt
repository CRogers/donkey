Introduction

5 pagish Donkey example to follow through. There are many reasons why
it is interesting to represent information in a logical language. You can do
things such as uniﬁcation, resolution, and question answering.
It is clear that not all sentences can be unambigiously translated from
natural language to logic. A sentence like
A farmer beats a donkey
Might be translated as
∃x(f armer(x) ∧ ∃y(donkey(y) ∧ beats(x, y)))

(1)

Indicating that “a farmer” refers to some speciﬁc individual. Or we can
might see it as a general rule, and translate it as
∀x(f armer(x) → ∃y(donkey(y) ∧ beats(x, y)))

(2)

Indicating that every farmer has some donkey he beats. Or we could even
read it as
∃y(donkey(y) ∧ ∀x(f armer(x) → beats(x, y)))
(3)
Indicating that the poor donkey is common between all farmers.
∀x.f armer(x) → (∀y.donkey(y) ∧ owns(x, y) → beats(x, y))

If a farmer owns a donkey he beats it
∀x.f armer(x) → (∀y.donkey(y) ∧ owns(x, y) → beats(x, y))
There are a lot of problems with this representation
• It is not compositional. dfdf
• It doesn’t very well follow the order of the original sentence
• It is just not very easy to get right
